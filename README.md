# BharatAkshar

BharatAkshar is a web application designed to transliterate text between Indian scripts. Users can either point their phone camera at a street sign or upload a photo, and the app will recognize the text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The script is automatically detected, and the text is converted into the user's preferred script without altering meaning or pronunciation.

This ensures that names of places and other text look different in writing but sound the same when read aloud, making it easy for travelers to read local signboards clearly.

## **Problem It Solves**

Traveling to another state in India can make reading local boards challenging due to unfamiliar scripts. BharatAkshar addresses this problem by:

- Displaying text in a script the user already knows.
- Saving time and reducing stress when understanding unknown scripts.
- Preserving pronunciation so names of places are spoken correctly.
- Making travel smoother and more comfortable for frequent travelers.

---

## **Innovation & Uniqueness**

- Unlike translation apps, BharatAkshar keeps the original meaning and pronunciation intact by only changing the script.
- Supports multiple Indian scripts in a single app â€” a rare feature.
- Real-time conversion using a phone camera (camera functionality in progress).
- Works on both web and mobile platforms.

---

## **Features**

- Supports multiple Indian languages for transliteration.
- Converts typed or scanned text into the chosen script.
- Speaks out text using text-to-speech functionality.
- Easy-to-use interface for fast and accurate conversion.

---

## **Current Status**

- Web prototype available with all features except real-time camera functionality (in progress).
